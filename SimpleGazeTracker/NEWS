  * Measure camera FPS during startup.

New in 0.11.1

  * A new parameter named "MORPH_TRANS" is added.  If this value is more than 1, morphological closing is applied before detecting pupil candidate.  If less than -1, morphological opening is applied.
  * A new menu item named "MorphologicalTrans" is added to adjust MORPH_TRANS.s

New in 0.11.0

  * Dialog for camera setup guide is shown at the first run.

New in 0.10.0

  * Manual calibration mode is added.
  * Camera image can be saved.

New in 0.9.0

  * Newer version of OpenCV (3.0) and SDL (2.0) are introduced.
  * Flycaptue2 edition supports Linux.
  * Camera image can be viewed during recording by pressing "L" key. Note that performance of SimpleGazeTracker degrades by drawing camera image.
  * Error dialog is shown when initialization of SimpleGazeTracker is failed. Configuration directory can be opened from the dialog.
  * Some debug codes are removed.

New in 0.8.2

  * A new command "getCameraImageSize" is added.
  * Camera mode is changed from "GrayscaleMode" to "MJPEGMode" in order to improve performance on V120slim camera (OptiTrack edition).

New in 0.8.1

  * SimpleGazeTracker does not stop if "MINPOINTS" and "MAXPOINTS" are in the CONFIG file. They are automatically removed.

New in 0.8.0

  * Calibration results are output to data file.
  * add "saveCalValResultsDetail" command is added to save raw calibration data.
  * "MINPOINTS" and "MAXPOINTS" options are obsolete in this version.
  * Width and height are used to select pupil candidate instead of contour length. Use MIN_PUPIL_WIDTH and MAX_PUPIL_WIDTH to specify acceptable pupil size (unit is percentage of ROI width)
  * Percentage of dark pixels in pupil candidates are checked to improve pupil detection.

New in 0.7.0

  * USBIO support (Windows & Linux)
  * Fix image-size setting in OptiTrack edition

New in 0.6.6
  
* Parameter directory and data directory can be changed with using command line option.
* Source files for Windows and Linux were integrated.
* GPC5300 edition supports WOW64 envirionment. This means that GPC5300 edition can run on 64bit Windows7/8.
* OptiTrack CameraSDK is used instead of OptiTrack 2D SDK to build OptiTrack edition. Thanks to this modification, OptiTrack edition can run on 64bit Windows8.

New in 0.6.5
  
* add "BLUR_FILTER_SIZE" option to SimpleGazeTracker FlyCapture2 edition.
* Custom output is supported in GPC5300 edition. Status of digital input port of CameraLink board is output to data file.
* Configuration files are searched from /usr/local/lib/simplegazetracker at first, then /usr/lib/simplegazetracker, and the current directory finally (Linux).
* Font file is searched from the directory where configuration files were found, then /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf, and the current directory finally (Linux).

New in 0.6.4

* Threading-mode is added to SimpleGazeTracker FlyCapture2 edition. Two options (USE_THREAD, SLEEP_DURATION) are added.
* "getEyePositionList" and "getWholeEyePositionList" commands are added to get a list of gaze position data.
* "getWholeMessageList" command is added to get a list of messages with timestamp.
* Moving-average mode is added to "getEyePosition" command.
* A bug in message initialization at the begining of recording is fixed.
* "isBinocularMode" command is added.
* Bug in "insertSettings" command is fixed (Command after inserteSettings was ignored).

New in 0.6.3

* SimpleGazeTracker FlyCapture2 edition is added.
* Detailed error message is output when CONFIG is not found in the installation directory.
* Camera image is visible between "startMeasurement" and "stopMeasurement" command.
* SimpleGazeTracker checks CONFIG and copy default CONFIG when CONFIG is not found.

New in 0.6.2

* "openDataFile" command receives a new parameter to overwrite/rename existing data file.

New in 0.6.1

* Configuration files with section header (e.g. [SimpleGazeTrackerCommon]) are supported to read SimpleGazeTracker configuration files using ConfigParser module. Old format (without section header) is also supported.
* Spaces and tabs are allowed before and after "=" in SimpleGazeTracker configuration files.
* "toggleCalResult" command receives a parameter which specifies on/off of calibration results.

New in 0.6.0

* "getEyePosition" command returns current pupil size.
* Terminator of data sent from SimpleGazeTracker is changed to \0 in all commands.
* A new parameter is added to "getCalSample" and "getValSample" commands to customize number of calibration samples per target position.
* Warning messages are logged when number of calibration samples exceeds MAXCALDATA (=7200)
* Warning messages are logged when number of calibration positions exceeds MAXCALPOINT (=60)

New in 0.5.3 (version 0.5.2 was skipped)

* configuration directory is changed to $HOME/.SimpleGazeTracker
  (in Windows, %APPDATA%/SimpleGazeTracer)
* Pupil size (area of ellipse fitted to the pupil) is recoreded.
* several bugs in binocular recording mode is fixed.

New in 0.5.1
